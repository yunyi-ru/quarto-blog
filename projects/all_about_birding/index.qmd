# Introduction

**I love birding!** Welcome to my personal birding records. I'm a casual birder who enjoys watching the most common birds in daily life (but appreciate a trip to the wilds!). 

You can see birds I've sighted all around the world at [**bird list**](#birdlist) (including an [**interactive map**](#map)) and all my favorite birding destinations at [**places I went for birding**](#places). [**Links and resources**](#links) are also provided.

***Note**: Only wild birds were recorded. All photos taken by me (most with Sony WX800). All pixel arts created by me.*


::: callout-note
The next bird I want to see is: ***Wood Duck***, because it's beautiful!

# Bird List

## My Bird List {#birdlist}

```{r bird list, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(DT)

bird_list <- read.csv("bird_df.csv", fileEncoding = "UTF-8")

kable(bird_list, col.names = gsub("[.]", " ", names(bird_list)))
```

### Milestones

Now I have spotted `r nrow(bird_list)` birds.

**100 birds spotted**: June 2025

**125 birds spotted**: Oct 2025

## Birding Around the World: Interactive Map {#map}

*Click on the map to see pictures of birds! Urban sites marked in pink while rural sites marked in green.*

```{r map, echo = FALSE}

Remember to bring your binoculars since there's a sign saying 'birds only beyond this point' - you would not be able to get too close to that rock. The volunteer is very friendly and helpful, and tide pools are also great fun to explore. Also, if you reside in Portland, be sure to check out Powell's books, it has a great collection of field guides as well as other gems.

# End Notes

Thanks Qinyi who introduced me to the world of birding. I will always remember watching night heron with you sitting next to Bixia Pond back in 2019 in the afternoon before taking a Biology exam.
