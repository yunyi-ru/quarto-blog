# Introduction

**I love birding!** Welcome to my personal birding records.

You can see birds I've sighted all around the world at [bird list](#birdlist) (including an [interactive map!](#map)) and all my favorite birding destinations at [places I went for birding](#places). [Links and resources](#links) are also provided. 

***Note**: Only wild birds were recorded. All photos taken by me (most with Sony WX800).*

::: callout-note
The next bird I want to see is: ***Blue Jay***, because it's the symbol of the Johns Hopkins community.

## Cannon Beach, OR: Haystack Rock

-   **Last Visited**: July 2024
-   **Birds**: Brown Pelican, California Gull, Tufted Puffin, Common Murre, Brandt's Cormorant, American Crow
-   **Comments**: It's just heaven if you love seabirds and shorebirds - in summer, various birds are nesting on the cliff of haystack rock. Remember to bring your binoculars since there's a sign saying 'birds only beyond this point' - you would not be able to get too close to that rock. The volunteer is very friendly and helpful, and tide pools are also great fun to explore. Also, if you reside in Portland, be sure to check out Powell's books, it has a great collection of field guides as well as other gems.

Thanks Qinyi who introduced me to the world of birding. I will always remember watching night heron with you sitting next to Bixia Pond back in 2019 in the afternoon before taking a Biology exam.
