-   **First Visited**: July 2024
-   **Last Visited**: July 2024
-   **Birds**: Brown Pelican, California Gull, Tufted Puffin, Common Murre, Double-crested Cormorant, American Crow
-   **Comments**: It's just heaven if you love shorebirds - all kinds of shorebirds are nesting on the cliff of haystack rock, just bring your binoculars since there's a sign saying 'birds only beyond this point' - you would not be able to get too close to that rock. The volunteer is very friendly and helpful, and tidepools are also great fun to explore. Also, if you reside in Portland, be sure to check out Powell's books, it has a great collection of field guides as well as other gems.

*Thanks Qinyi who introduced me to the world of birding. I always remember watching night heron with you sitting next to Bixia Pond back in 2019 in the afternoon before taking a Biology exam.*
