:tada: Hi, this is my first blog post!

This blog is built as a project of the [statistical computing](https://lcolladotor.github.io/jhustatcomputing/) class I'm taking.

## Resources

I used RStudio + GitHub Pages (rendered to `docs`) to build this page.

Here are some useful resources for a blogging newbie... Will add more in future definitely!

-   [**Quarto Guide**](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)

-   [**The Ultimate Guide to Starting a Quarto Blog** by Albert Rapp](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html)
