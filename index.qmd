Hi, Iâ€™m Yunyi, a ScM student at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

I am currently doing virology research at [the Pekosz lab](https://pekoszlab.com/). I also worked as a research assistant for resposible science communication at [the R3ISE center](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/the-r3-center-for-innovation-in-science-education). For more information, please visit [my profile page](https://yunyi-ru.github.io/).

Looking forward to sharing some useful information with you here! :paw_prints:
