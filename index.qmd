# About this blog

Hi, I'm Yunyi Ru, a ScM student at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/).

I am currently doing virology research at [The Pekosz Lab](https://pekoszlab.com/) and also work as a research assistant at [R3ISE Center](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/the-r3-center-for-innovation-in-science-education). 

Looking forward to sharing some useful information with you here! :paw_prints:
