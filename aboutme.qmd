## Fun Facts About Me

Outside of lab, I enjoy digital painting, birding, and listening and playing music.

My name Yunyi writes as 云衣 in Chinese - it comes from a poem by Li Bai, a poet my mom loves:

> *云想衣裳花想容，春风拂槛露华浓。The clouds resemble her dress, and the flowers mirror her beauty. In the spring breeze brushing against the balcony, the dewdrops gleam richly. (English Translation provided by ChatGPT)*
