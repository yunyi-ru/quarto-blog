### Me <img src="figs/crow_s.png" class="bird-swap" data-hover="figs/crow_s_flip.png"/>

My name is Yunyi. I am a Ph.D. student at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I major in life sciences, and my research interest resides in immunology and host-pathogen interaction.

I was born in Suzhou, China, a beautiful watertown; and I'm currently living in Lafayette, Indiana. Outside of lab, I enjoy digital painting, reading, [birdwatching](projects/all_about_birding/birding.qmd), and listening to music.

### Why Blogging

This blog started as a class project to build professional profile in one of my biostats classes. Over time, I decided to make it more personal, as I have been feeling increasingly overwhelmed by social media platforms. So what you'll see here would be a mix of life science-related and more fun/personal projects. You can filter them using tags.

### What's *that* bird?

'Raven' has been my online name from a very, very young age... so I kind of adopted it as my favicon/logo. Corvids like shiny things, and I think blogging nowadays is like collecting and displaying trinkets online - inherent resemblance?

When I lived in Baltimore, I used to see flocks of American crows and fish crows gathering on trees during colder times at dusk and dawn, and that's so fun. Tried to re-create that effect in the homepage XD
