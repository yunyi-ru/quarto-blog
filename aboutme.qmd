### Why Blogging

This blog started as a class project to build a professional profile in one of my biostats classes. Over time, I decided to make it more personal. Blogging offers a peaceful online experience without big company manipulation - no ads, no infinite scrolling. So, what you'll see here would be a mix of life science-related and more fun/personal projects. I sometimes also write in Chinese. You can filter them using tags.

### Why's it called *'Raven's Nest'*

*'Raven'* has always been my online name, so I adopted it as my favicon/logo. Corvids like shiny trinkets, and I think blogging nowadays is like collecting and displaying trinkets online - maybe there are some inherent resemblance?

When I lived in Baltimore, I used to see flocks of American crows and fish crows gathering on trees during colder times at dusk and dawn. Sometimes what you think is a tree would actually be a flock of birds. I tried to re-create that effect in the homepage XD
