Only the top 30 results are shown here.'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is kind of amusing. Ride and mbv rely their vocals heavily on harmonies and hummings - and it‚Äôs reflected honestly here, while slowdive has the most ‚Äòmeaningful‚Äô lyrics among the three. ‚ÄòLove‚Äô is the ultimate meaning of rock and roll, and it indeed appears in high frequency in all of their lyrics.\n\n\nWhich bands have the longest and shortest lyrics?\n\n# plotting\nggplot(lyrics_clean, aes(x = Album, y = lyric.length, fill = Artist)) + \n  geom_boxplot(color = 'black') +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = palette) +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Which bands have the Longest/Shortest Lyrics?',\n    caption = 'Boxplot showing the range and median of lyric lengths for each Album.', \n    color = 'Before Reunion?', \n    y = 'Lyric Length (character)'\n  ) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the three bands, Mbv always has the shortest lyrics overall while Ride has the longest. An interesting trend is that while Ride and slowdive have similar lyric length back in the 90s, after reunion, Ride tends to have longer lyrics - and the length increases for each album.\n\n\nWho is the saddest shoegaze band?\nI used afinn from package tidytext for sentiment analysis based on this paper(Koto and Adriani 2015).\n\n# data processing: sentiment 'afinn'\ntoken_count &lt;- token_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist, Album, Release.Year) %&gt;%\n  count(Word, name = 'Word_count', sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\ntoken_afinn &lt;- token_count %&gt;%\n  inner_join(get_sentiments('afinn'), by = c(\"Word\" = \"word\"))\n\nafinn_score_by_artist &lt;- token_afinn %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg = round(mean(value), 2)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nkable(afinn_score_by_artist)\n\n\n\n\nArtist\navg\n\n\n\n\nRide\n-0.06\n\n\nSlowdive\n0.00\n\n\nmy bloody valentine\n-0.11\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the three bands, mbv has the lowest sentiment score, which means it is the saddest shoegaze band (if we only look at the lyrics). All three bands got sentiment scores less than or equal to zero, with slowdive holding the highest score (0.00).\n\nWhat about their greatest hits?\nUsing data from last.fm, we find out that the greatest hits of the three bands are:\n\nwhen you sleep - my bloody valentine (32171 weekly listeners),\nVapour Trail - Ride (1943 weekly listeners), and\nWhen the Sun Hits - Slowdive (53055 weekly listeners).\n\nI‚Äôm interested that whether those songs have a happier or sadder vibe compared to their other songs -\n\n# by song\ntoken_count_bysong &lt;- token_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist, Song.Title) %&gt;%\n  count(Word, name = 'Word_count', sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# give afinn score\ntoken_afinn_bysong &lt;- token_count_bysong %&gt;%\n  inner_join(get_sentiments('afinn'), by = c(\"Word\" = \"word\"))\n\n# clean data set, drop songs with only 1/2 rows\ntoken_afinn_bysong &lt;- token_afinn_bysong %&gt;%\n  group_by(Song.Title) %&gt;%\n  filter(n() &gt; 2) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# calculate average scores\nafinn_score_all &lt;- token_afinn_bysong %&gt;%\n  group_by(Song.Title, Artist) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg_song = mean(value))\n\n# look at the greatest hits\nafinn_score_gh &lt;- afinn_score_all %&gt;%\n  filter(Song.Title == 'Vapour Trail' | Song.Title == 'When the Sun Hits' | Song.Title == 'when you sleep')\n\n# combine datasets for plotting\nafinn_score_gh &lt;- inner_join(afinn_score_gh, afinn_score_by_artist, by = c(\"Artist\" = \"Artist\"))\n\n# plot\nggplot(afinn_score_gh, aes(x = Artist)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 16, size = 3, aes(y = afinn_score_gh$avg, color = Artist)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 17, size = 3, aes(y = afinn_score_gh$avg_song, color = \nSong.Title)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = palette) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed', color = 'black') +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Who is the Saddest Shoegaze Band?',\n    caption = 'Average sentiment score calculated based on afinn scores.\\n&lt;0: sad/negative, &gt;0: happy/positive.', \n    y = 'Sentiment Score', \n    x = 'Time', \n    color = 'Artist average/\\ngreatest hits'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMbv has the lowest overall sentiment score. All those songs have a slightly higher sentiment score than their artist‚Äôs average scores. People seem to prefer happy songs!\n\n\nSo what are their happiest/saddest songs?\n\nextreme_song &lt;- afinn_score_all %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist) %&gt;%\n  filter(avg_song == max(avg_song) | avg_song == min(avg_song)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nsorted_tibble &lt;- extreme_song %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Artist, avg_song) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nkable(sorted_tibble)\n\n\n\n\nSong.Title\nArtist\navg_song\n\n\n\n\nI Came to See the Wreck\nRide\n-1.500000\n\n\nOnly Now\nRide\n-1.500000\n\n\nThe Dawn Patrol\nRide\n2.000000\n\n\nThe Sadman\nSlowdive\n-2.333333\n\n\nEveryone Knows\nSlowdive\n3.000000\n\n\nif i am\nmy bloody valentine\n-1.400000\n\n\nonly shallow\nmy bloody valentine\n2.000000\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the table above, we find that Ride‚Äôs saddest songs are ‚ÄòI Came to See the Wreck‚Äô and ‚ÄòOnly Now‚Äô, and happiest songs is ‚ÄòThe Dawn Patrol‚Äô; Slowdive‚Äôs saddest song is ‚ÄòThe Sadman‚Äô, and happiest songs is ‚ÄòEveryone Knows‚Äô; mbv‚Äôs saddest song is ‚Äòif i am‚Äô, and happiest song is ‚Äòonly shallow‚Äô. The Sadman is really sad.\n\n\n\nAre bands trending towards happiness or sadness over time?\n\nafinn_score &lt;- token_afinn %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist, Album, Release.Year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg = mean(value))\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nggplot(afinn_score,\n       aes(x = Release.Year, y = avg, color = Artist, label = Album)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_text_repel(size = 3) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed', color = 'black') +\n  scale_color_manual(values = palette) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-1,1)) +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Sentiment Trend of Lyrics Over Time',\n    caption = 'Average sentiment score calculated based on afinn scores.\\n&lt;0: sad/negative, &gt;0: happy/positive.',\n    color = 'Artist',\n    y = 'Sentiment Score', \n    x = 'Time'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen examining the trend over time, it is noteworthy that at the beginning of their careers, the bands all had very sad lyrics; in the middle of their careers, their lyrics became more positive. It is also interesting to observe that the latest albums of mbv, Ride, and Slowdive are all among the saddest of their entire careers."

    "text": "Project\nThis Weather-Respiratory Diseases Correlation Explorer R Shiny Dashboard aims to investigate the relationship between climate and weather-related conditions and outbreaks of two respiratory viruses, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).\n\nInfluenza is an RNA virus from the Orthomyxoviridae family that frequently mutates, causing seasonal epidemics, while RSV is an RNA virus from the Paramyxoviridae family that primarily affects young children and the elderly, often leading to severe lower respiratory infections. Both viruses pose significant public health challenges due to their widespread transmission and potential for severe disease.\nClimate and weather conditions can influence the activity and spread of both viruses. Studies have suggested that factors like cold temperatures, low indoor humidity, limited sunlight, and rapid weather changes may increase the risk of disease outbreaks.\n\n\nFeatures\n\nWeekly Rates: This dashboard uses CDC RESP-NET data to give an overview of influenza and rsv hospitalization rates of each state from 2018 to 2024. The user can select year, state, and pathogen of interest using the interactive filters.\n\n\n\nWeather Explorer: This dashboard integrates environmental parameter data from openmeteo API and respiratory virus-associated hospitalization rate data to perform regression analysis. The user can select year, state, weather variable and pathogen of interest using the interactive filters.\n\n\n\n\nData\n\nRespiratory Virus Related Hospitalization Rate: Disease rate data were scrapped from CDC RESP-NET.\nEnvironmental Parameters: Weather data were scrapped from Openmeteo API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease go to the source repository for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam\nTeam MMI are Yunyi Ru (email; GitHub) and Juanyu Zhang (email; GitHub).\n\nThis is a class project of Johns Hopkins University Biostatistics 140.777 Statistical Programming Paradigms course."
